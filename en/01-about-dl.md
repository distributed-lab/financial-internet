# ABOUT DISTRIBUTED LAB

Distributed Lab (https://distributedlab.com/) was founded in 2014 as an R&D company. We started to work on a wide 
variety of projects from wallets to digital banks, all operating in the field of accounting and management of assets. 
It became obvious that dozens of thousands of engineers were reinventing the wheel again and again building very similar 
systems.

We saw the potential that blockchain technology could bring to business operations and became extremely excited about 
it. At one point, we realized that we ought to spread the news about the bright future, for one simple reason: it is 
impossible to create advanced systems without a proper education focused on the deep understanding of the principles of 
blockchain and decentralized technologies. That’s how we came up with a cornerstone of building the Financial Internet 
in 2015—through conducting research and knowledge sharing.

The closest goal is digitization (tokenization) of asset management systems. To make this happen we created a framework 
called TokenD (https://tokend.io/) — therefore since 2018, we became entirely a product company. We see our product as a 
white label processing center for digital assets or, you could say, “Wordpress” for digitization. Our framework is 
needed to build your own systems faster, cheaper and safer than ever before. It appeared as a consequence of years of 
work on different projects that, as we then realized, were essentially asking for the same thing. This “thing” is an 
accounting system which is secure, with wallets for users, a ledger for assets, an internal payment system, an exchange, 
modules that manage identities, roles, the lifecycle of assets, and gateways for external integrations. Having combined 
everything mentioned, TokenD allows one to launch a digital asset ecosystem within days for a fraction of the cost of 
the in-house development.

During the crazy hype period of 2017, we stayed calm and didn’t participate in any ICO while being focused on the search 
for real business value that blockchain and related technologies can deliver. We decided to commit ourselves to the long 
journey of transforming the world with technology.
