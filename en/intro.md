# INTRODUCTION

Why is sending money not as easy as sending an email? Why are there so many different payment systems available that do 
not integrate well with each other? Why is paying on the internet so inconvenient?

Some merchants accept only internationally recognized credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard. Other merchants accept 
only locally-issued credit cards. In contrast, vending machines usually accept only small bills or coins. And, the 
minimum amount of a credit card transaction can be 10 euro. Furthermore, it is at least difficult and often impossible 
to send money from a bank account to a credit card. Even worse, consider land registries, warehouse receipts, and 
intellectual property; in the worst cases, they are still accounted for on paper, and even if there is a digital system 
in place, it usually does not provide an open API and thus an easy customer journey.

What’s interesting is that in many cases, people don’t even notice that something isn’t right. We got used to the world 
we are living in. We can’t even imagine that it could be different. The fact, however, remains that sending a payment 
will at some point be as simple as sending an email or a message on social media. Think about it, would a person living 
in the 19th century have ever imagined that people will be able to communicate with each other easily and instantly 
while being located in different parts of the world? While today, we take it for granted. Beyond that, when was the last 
time you wrote a letter with a pen out of necessity?

This book tells the story about Financial Internet in the way we see it. Financial Internet is built for consumers. It 
is needed for financial institutions, while it will bring a substantial change in the role of banks and their services. 
It will replace the cumbersome process of managing one’s assets with a few taps on a smartphone. Financial Internet is 
expected to represent ownership rights of assets in a unified way and to provide access to accounting systems using the 
uniform protocols (such as HTTP).

## WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR
In this book, we will describe Financial Internet as a technology stack. We will cover its main components, processes, 
four main entities—private data, identity, transactions, and assets—their lifecycle as well as the related 
considerations, namely security, privacy, and interoperability.

Therefore, the book is best for:

*Engineers/architects* that develop financial applications: digital payment/remittance systems, wallets, asset 
management systems, crowdfunding systems, etc.

*Members of technical committees* who are busy with the unification and standardization of protocols and approaches.

*Students* who want to learn how financial applications work.

*Innovation managers/engineers* who want to see how new technologies can benefit their businesses.
